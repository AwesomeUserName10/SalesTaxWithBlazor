<p>Basic tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are
exempt. Import duty is an additional tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exceptions.

For a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np / 100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of
    tax.
